    <h2> Look below and see more factors that come into play in deforestation. </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Habitat Loss: Many species rely on forests as their primary habitat. Deforestation destroys their homes, leaving them displaced and struggling to find food, shelter, and
        mates.
      <li>Species Extinction:When forests are cleared, species that are unable to adapt or migrate quickly enough face extinction. This loss of biodiversity can disrupt entire ecosystems and lead to cascading effects throughout the food chain.

      <li> Disruption of Migration Routes: Deforestation can disrupt migration routes for animals, especially for species that rely on specific forest corridors to travel between habitats. This can lead to isolation of populations and decreased genetic diversity.
      <li>Loss of Food Sources: Many animals depend on forests for their food sources, whether it's fruits, nuts, insects, or other animals. Deforestation can disrupt these food chains, leading to food shortages and increased competition for survival.
      <li>Increased Human-Wildlife Conflict: As forests shrink and animals lose their natural habitats, they are forced to venture into human settlements in search of food and shelter. This can lead to conflicts between humans and wildlife, resulting in injury or death for both humans and animals.
      <li>Climate Impact: Forests play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation releases stored carbon back into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change, which can further disrupt habitats and endanger animal populations.

          <p class="animal">Believe it or not but deforestation has an impact on various animal species from orangutans and tigers to parrots, eagles, frogs, salamanders, snakes, turtles, beetles, butterflies, fish, small mammals and invertebrates. This leads to the loss of habitats and their fragmentation and degradation. Ultimately it poses a threat to biodiversity. Raises the likelihood of extinction, for many species.</p>
